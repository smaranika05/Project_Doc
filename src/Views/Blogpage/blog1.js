          Online-conversions through online-measures such as websites or
          e-commerce are an important pillar for a successful sales process. In
          this vast and dense market though, it is hard to find an easy way to
          optimize website. An ever-changing algorithm from search engines such as
          Google and Bing, further complicate the structure of a successful online
          construct.
