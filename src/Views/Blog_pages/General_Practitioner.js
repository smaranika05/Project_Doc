        <h2>For your patients</h2>
        <p>
          Nowadays, online reservations and online bookings often render phone
          calls to make appointments unnecessary. Immediate visibility of
          available slots, email confirmation and online calendar
          synchronization are widely acknowledged by patients in an emerging
          Digital First world. A bookable calendar lets you create, accept and
          manage appointments and is part of a scheduling software.
        </p>
        <p>
          A bookable calendar, might make the appointment process seem more
          impersonal. Yet, it does not affect the actual appointment itself,
          where the rapport of medical staff and patients is always going to
          stay personal.
        </p>

        <h2>For you as a doctor</h2>
        <p>
          You will experience a better visibility on the expected workload.
          Appointments are instantaneously synchronized in your online calendar
          (e.g. Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook Calendar, iCalendar). Also,
          any scheduling software can be part of a solution in which only a
          portion of consultation hours can be booked online (where the rest is
          assigned via phone or does not require an appointment).
